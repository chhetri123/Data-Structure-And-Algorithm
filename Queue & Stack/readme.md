Can be performed only from
one end, called the top.

## Operations

- (1) Push (x)

## Insert/delete

- at end of list (tail) //O(n)

- Enqueue (x) or Push(x)
- Dequeue() or pop() /// Constant time or O(1)
- Front() or Peek()
- IsEmpty()

Applications

1. Printer queue
2. Process scheduding
3. Simulating wait

### Implementation Queue using

1. Arrays
2. Linked List

Array implementation

### What if arrays gets filled?

1.  Sorry, Queue is Full"
2.  Create a new, array
    and Copy data
