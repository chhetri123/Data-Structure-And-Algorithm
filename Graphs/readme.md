## **Graphs**

### Graph:

A graph **G** is an ordered pair of set **V** of vertices and a set **E** of edges.

G=(V,E)

### Ordered pair:

(a,b)!=(b,a) if a!=b

### Unordered pair:

{a,b}=(b,a)

### Edges :

we have two edges :

1. Directed edges
2. Undirected edges

### Properties of Graphs

1. Weighted Graph
2. Self Loop
3. Multi Edge Or Parallel edge

:Note : If there is no self loop or multiedge then it is a simple graph

4. Path

   - A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge .
     <A, B, F,H>

5. Simple Path
   - A path in which no vertices (thus no edges ) are repeated.
6. Trail

   - A path in which no edges are repeated.

7. Strongly connected Graph

   - If there is a path from any vertix to other vertix

8. Close path
   - If it starts and ends with same vertix
9. Simple cycle
   - No repetation other than start and end
10. Acyclic Graph
    - A graph with no cycles
