## why we want to create doubly linked list? what are the advantages of this approach?

- we have the pointer to any look ,now we can do forward look up and reverse look up.
  In singly Linked list you will have to use of extra pointer to look up or keep track of the previous
  node.

- Deletion is easier .

## Disadvantage :

- Extra memory for pointer to previous node
