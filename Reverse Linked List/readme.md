# Iterative vs Recursive

<h3> For the normal traversal of Linked list an iterative approach is much more efficent
than the recursive apporach.
Because in iterative apporach we just use one temporary variable
while in recursion we will use space and the stack of the memory foe so many
function calls so there is implicit use of their.
For reverse print operation we will anyway have to store element in some structure
so if we use recursion its still ok. </h3>
